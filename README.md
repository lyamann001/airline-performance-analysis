# airline-performance-analysis
In this analysis, we examined a dataset of 5,000 flight bookings (all on 2025-09-29) to extract
key business insights. The data includes customer demographics (Age, Gender, Nationality,
Loyalty Status), booking channels, flight details (Route, Scheduled Time), delays and
cancellations, and ticket/revenue information (Ticket Class, fares, seat/meal revenues, total
revenue). We used Python for data cleaning and exploration and Power BI for visualizations,
aiming to identify trends in customer segments, booking behavior, cancellations, delays, and
revenue drivers
We cleaned the data and calculated summary statistics, then built interactive charts in Power BI.
Our goal was to highlight the most important trends: who the customers are, how they booked
flights, how often flights were delayed or cancelled, and which ticket classes and add-ons generated
revenue.
